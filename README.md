# Discord In Gorilla Tag

(GTISCORD)

I made this mod using banana hook to create a mod that allows you to use discord while playing gorilla tag.
Not to mention, I also added some extra keyboard keys.

It's not out, but I've been working on it.


TO INSTALL YOU'LL NEED:

COMPUTER INTERFACE, BANANA HOOK, UTILLA, YOU MUST BE IN MY DISCORD FOR THIS TO WORK, 
AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE MOD IT'S SELF IN YOUR DOWNLOADS. THIS ONLY WORKS ON PCVR (Quest coming soon.)

To access it go to MOD STATUS - GTAG DISCORD - LOGIN - Then go to the link it tells you to go to, connect your
discord account to the bot in my server called GTAG RECIEVER and then chat in there. 

If you have any questions, DM me. (Just find my username in the discord.)
